# Greenbigdata

This repository contains a Makefile-based pipeline to download, process, and prepare genomic datasets for machine learning models, particularly greenbig. The pipeline includes steps for downloading FASTA and GTF files, generating feature files, splitting datasets into training and testing sets, and organizing the data for memory-efficient training using bucketing.
